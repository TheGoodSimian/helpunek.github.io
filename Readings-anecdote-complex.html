  <h1>Complex Anecdotes</h1>
  <h2 class="text" id="text">Now let's look at a more complex anecdote. Often, when telling a story, we need to provide additional context
     or clarify the chronological order. We do this using the <span class="past-perfect">past perfect</span>. Just as in a simpler anecdote, we still use the <span class="past-simple">past simple</span> and the <span class="past-continuous">past continuous</span>.</h2>
  <div class="text" id="text">
    <p>Several years ago I <span class="past-simple">was</span> in Nepal with a group of friends receiving a
      series of teachings from a Tibetan Lama. This teacher <span class="past-simple">lived</span> in a
      monastery at the top of a hill. Each day we <span class="past-simple">would ascend</span> the hill by a trail
      that <span class="past-simple">passed</span> a few little village shops near the base, then <span class="past-simple">wove</span> back
      and forth in switchbacks until it <span class="past-simple">reached</span> the monastery perched at its
      summit. One day we <span class="past-continuous">were hurrying</span> up the trail. I <span class="past-simple">turned</span> to notice that
      two friends <span class="past-perfect">had fallen</span> behind. They <span class="past-perfect">had stopped</span></span> at the outskirts of the
      tiny village and <span class="past-continuous">were standing</span> near a sobbing young girl. She <span class="past-perfect">had been sent</span>
      to the shop to purchase two eggs but <span class="past-perfect">had</span> accidentally <span class="past-perfect">broken</span> one
      and <span class="past-simple">was</span> afraid to go home for fear her mother <span class="past-simple">would beat</span> her. My
      friends <span class="past-perfect">had stopped</span> and <span class="past-perfect">talked</span> with her, and <span class="past-perfect">had sent</span> a boy with two
      rupees to buy another egg.</p>
