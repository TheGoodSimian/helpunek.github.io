  <div>Source: The Seven Ravens</div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence">There was once a man who had seven sons, and still he had no daughter, however much he wished for one.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At length his wife again gave him hope of a child, and when it came into the world it was a girl.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The joy was great, but the child was sickly and small, and had to be privately baptized on account of its weakness.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The father sent one of the boys in haste to the spring to fetch water for the baptism.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The other six went with him, and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it, the jug fell into the well.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> There they stood and did not know what to do, and none of them dared to go home.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As they still did not return, the father grew impatient, and said, they have certainly forgotten it while playing some game, the wicked boys.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He became afraid that the girl would have to die without being baptized, and in his anger cried, I wish the boys were all turned into ravens.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Hardly was the word spoken before he heard a whirring of wings over his head, looked up and saw seven coal-black ravens flying away.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The parents could not withdraw the curse, and however sad they were at the loss of their seven sons, they still to some extent comforted themselves with their dear little daughter, who soon grew strong and every day became more beautiful.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> For a long time she did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents were careful not to mention them before her, but one day she accidentally heard some people saying of herself, that the girl was certainly beautiful, but that in reality she was to blame for the misfortune which had befallen her seven brothers.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she was much troubled, and went to her father and mother and asked if it was true that she had had brothers, and what had become of them.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The parents now dared keep the secret no longer, but said that what had befallen her brothers was the will of heaven, and that her birth had only been the innocent cause.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the maiden took it to heart daily, and thought she must save her brothers.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She had no rest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the wide world to search for her brothers and set them free, let it cost what it might.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision against weariness.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And now she went continually onwards, far, far to the very end of the world.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she came to the sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and devoured little children.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Hastily she ran away, and ran to the moon, but it was far too cold, and also awful and malicious, and when it saw the child, it said, I smell, I smell the flesh of men.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At this she ran swiftly away, and came to the stars, which were kind and good to her, and each of them sat on its own particular little chair.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the morning star arose, and gave her the drumstick of a chicken, and said, if you have not that drumstick you can not open the glass mountain, and in the glass mountain are your brothers.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The maiden took the drumstick, wrapped it carefully in a cloth, and went onwards again until she came to the glass mountain.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The door was shut, and she thought she would take out the drumstick.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But when she undid the cloth, it was empty, and she had lost the good star's present.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What was she now to do.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She wished to rescue her brothers, and had no key to the glass mountain.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The good sister took a knife, cut off one of her little fingers, put it in the door, and succeeded in opening it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When she had gone inside, a little dwarf came to meet her, who said, my child, what are you looking for.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens, she replied.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The dwarf said, the lord ravens are not at home, but if you will wait here until they come, step in.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Thereupon the little dwarf carried the ravens' dinner in, on seven little plates, and in seven little glasses, and the little sister ate a morsel from each plate, and from each little glass she took a sip, but in the last little glass she dropped the ring which she had brought away with her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Suddenly she heard a whirring of wings and a rushing through the air, and then the little dwarf said, now the lord ravens are flying home.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then they came, and wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then said one after the other, who has eaten something from my plate.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Who has drunk out of my little glass.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It was a human mouth.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass, the ring rolled against his mouth.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he looked at it, and saw that it was a ring belonging to his father and mother, and said, God grant that our sister may be here, and then we shall be free.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the maiden, who was standing behind the door watching, heard that wish, she came forth, and on this all the ravens were restored to their human form again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And they embraced and kissed each other, and went joyfully home.</div></div>
