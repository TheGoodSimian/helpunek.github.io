  <div>Source: The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs</div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence">There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son, and as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted that in his fourteenth year he would have the king's daughter for his wife.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It happened that soon afterwards the king came into the village, and no one knew that he was the king, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered, a child has just been born with a caul on, whatever anyone so born undertakes turns out well.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It is prophesied, too, that in his fourteenth year he will have the king's daughter for his wife.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said, you poor people, let me have your child, and I will take care of it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At first they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large amount of gold for it, and they thought, it is a child of good fortune, and everything must turn out well for it, they at last consented, and gave him the child.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water, then he threw the box into it and thought, I have freed my daughter from her undesired suitor.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not a drop of water made its way into it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And it floated to within two miles of the king's chief city, where there was a mill, and it came to a halt at the mill-dam.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> A miller's boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He took him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children they were glad, and said, 'God has given him to us'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> They took great care of the foundling, and he grew up in all goodness.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It happened that once in a storm, the king went into the mill, and asked the mill-folk if the tall youth were their son.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> No, answered they, he's a foundling.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Fourteen years ago he floated down to the mill-dam in a box, and the mill-boy pulled him out of the water.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the king knew that it was none other than the child of good fortune which he had thrown into the water, and he said, my good people, could not the youth take a letter to the queen.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I will give him two gold pieces as a reward.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Just as the king commands, answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the king wrote a letter to the queen, wherein he said, as soon as the boy arrives with this letter, let him be killed and buried, and all must be done before I come home.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The boy set out with this letter, but he lost his way, and in the evening came to a large forest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In the darkness he saw a small light, he went towards it and reached a cottage.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When he went in, an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She started when she saw the boy, and said, whence do you come, and whither are you going.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I come from the mill, he answered, and wish to go to the queen, to whom I am taking a letter, but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> You poor boy, said the woman, you have come into a den of thieves, and when they come home they will kill you.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Let them come, said the boy, I am not afraid, but I am so tired that I cannot go any farther.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Soon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ah, said the old woman, it is an innocent child who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have let him come in, he has to take a letter to the queen.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The robbers opened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the hardhearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the king's daughter.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke they gave him the letter, and showed him the right way.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And the queen, when she had received the letter and read it, did as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast prepared, and the king's daughter was married to the child of good fortune, and as the youth was handsome and friendly she lived with him in joy and contentment.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> After some time the king returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled, and the child married to his daughter.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> How has that come to pass, said he, I gave quite another order in my letter.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So the queen gave him the letter, and said that he might see for himself what was written in it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He asked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him, and why he had brought another instead of it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I know nothing about it, answered he, it must have been changed in the night, when I slept in the forest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king said in a passion, you shall not have everything quite so much your own way, whosoever marries my daughter must fetch me from hell three golden hairs from the head of the devil, bring me what I want, and you shall keep my daughter.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In this way the king hoped to be rid of him for ever.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the child of good fortune answered, I will fetch the golden hairs, I am not afraid of the devil.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Whereupon he took leave of them and began his journey.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The road led him to a large town, where the watchman by the gates asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I know everything, answered the child of good fortune.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then you can do us a favor, said the watchman, if you will tell us why our market fountain, which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> That you shall know, answered he, only wait until I come back.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he went farther and came to another town, and there also the gatekeeper asked him what was his trade, and what he knew.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I know everything, answered he.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then you can do us a favor and tell us why a tree in our town which once bore golden apples now does not even put forth leaves.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> You shall know that, answered he, only wait until I come back.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he went on and came to a wide river over which he must cross.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The ferryman asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I know everything, answered he.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then you can do me a favor, said the ferryman, and tell me why I must always be rowing backwards and forwards, and am never set free.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> You shall know that, answered he, only wait until I come back.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When he had crossed the water he found the entrance to hell.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It was black and sooty within, and the devil was not at home, but his grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What do you want, said she to him, but she did not look so very wicked.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I should like to have three golden hairs from the devil's head, answered he, else I cannot keep my wife.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> That is a good deal to ask for, said she, if the devil comes home and finds you, it will cost you your life, but as I pity you, I will see if I cannot help you.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She changed him into an ant and said, creep into the folds of my dress, you will be safe there.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Yes, answered he, so far, so good, but there are three things besides that I want to know - why a fountain which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water, why a tree which once bore golden apples does not even put forth leaves, and why a ferryman must always be going backwards and forwards, and is never set free.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Those are difficult questions, answered she, but just be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out the three golden hairs.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As the evening came on, the devil returned home.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I smell man's flesh, said he, all is not right here.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he pried into every corner, and searched, but could not find anything.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> His grandmother scolded him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It has just been swept, said she, and everything put in order, and now you are upsetting it again, you have always got man's flesh in your nose.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Sit down and eat your supper.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When he had eaten and drunk he was tired, and laid his head in his grandmother's lap, and told her she should louse him a little.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It was not long before he was fast asleep, snoring and breathing heavily.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled it out, and laid it down beside her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Oh, cried the devil, what are you doing.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I have had a bad dream, answered the grandmother, so I seized hold of your hair.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What did you dream then, said the devil.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I dreamt that a fountain in a market-place from which wine once flowed was dried up, and not even water would flow out of it - what is the cause of it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Oh, ho, if they did but know it, answered the devil, there is a toad sitting under a stone in the well - if they killed it, the wine would flow again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The grandmother loused him again until he went to sleep and snored so that the windows shook.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she pulled the second hair out.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ha, what are you doing, cried the devil angrily.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Do not take it ill, said she, I did it in a dream.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What have you dreamt this time, asked he.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I dreamt that in a certain kingdom there stood an apple-tree which had once borne golden apples, but now would not even bear leaves.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What, think you, was the reason.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Oh, if they did but know, answered the devil.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> A mouse is gnawing at the root - if they killed it they would have golden apples again, but if it gnaws much longer the tree will wither altogether.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But I have had enough of your dreams, if you disturb me in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The grandmother spoke gently to him and picked his lice once more until he fell asleep and snored.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The devil jumped up, roared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him again and said, who can help bad dreams.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What was the dream, then, asked he, and was quite curious.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I dreamt of a ferryman who complained that he must always ferry from one side to the other, and was never released.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What is the cause of it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ah, the fool, answered the devil, when anyone comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As the grandmother had plucked out the three golden hairs, and the three questions were answered, she let the old devil alone, and he slept until daybreak.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the devil had gone out again the old woman took the ant out of the folds of her dress, and gave the child of good fortune his human shape again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> There are the three golden hairs for you, said she.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What the devil said to your three questions, I suppose you heard.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Yes, answered he, I heard, and will take care to remember.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> You have what you want, said she, and now you can go your way.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He thanked the old woman for helping him in his need, and left hell well content that everything had turned out so fortunately.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When he came to the ferryman he was expected to give the promised answer.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ferry me across first, said the child of good fortune, and then I will tell you how you can be set free, and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil's advice.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Next time anyone comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful tree, and there too the watchman wanted an answer.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So he told him what he had heard from the devil.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Kill the mouse which is gnawing at its root, and it will again bear golden apples.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold, which followed him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Finally, he came to the town whose well was dry.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He told the watchman what the devil had said, a toad is in the well beneath a stone, you must find it and kill it, and the well will again give wine in plenty.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The watchman thanked him, and also gave him two asses laden with gold.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At last the child of good fortune got home to his wife, who was heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had prospered in everything.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> To the king he took what he had asked for, the devil's three golden hairs, and when the king saw the four asses laden with gold he was quite content, and said, now all the conditions are fulfilled, and you can keep my daughter.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But tell me, dear son-in-law, where did all that gold come from - this is tremendous wealth.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I was rowed across a river, answered he, and got it there, it lies on the shore instead of sand.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Can I too fetch some of it, said the king, and he was quite eager about it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As much as you like, answered he.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> There is a ferryman on the river, let him ferry you over, and you can fill your sacks on the other side.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The greedy king set out in all haste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferryman to put him across.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The ferryman came and bade him get in, and when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his hand and sprang over.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But from this time forth the king had to ferry, as a punishment for his sins.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Perhaps he is ferrying still.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from him.</div></div>
