  <div>Source: The Girl Without Hands</div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence">A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty, and had nothing left but his mill and a large apple-tree behind it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Once when he had gone into the forest to fetch wood, an old man stepped up to him whom he had never seen before, and said, why do you plague yourself with cutting wood, I will make you rich, if you will promise me what is standing behind your mill.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What can that be but my apple-tree, thought the miller, and said, yes, and gave a written promise to the stranger.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He, however, laughed mockingly and said, when three years have passed, I will come and carry away what belongs to me, and then he went.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the miller got home, his wife came to meet him and said, tell me, miller, from whence comes this sudden wealth into our house.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> All at once every box and chest was filled, no one brought it in, and I know not how it happened.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He answered, it comes from a stranger who met me in the forest, and promised me great treasure.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I' in return, have promised him what stands behind the mill - we can very well give him the big apple-tree for it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ah, husband, said the terrified wife, that must have been the devil.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He did not mean the apple-tree, but our daughter, who was standing behind the mill sweeping the yard.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The miller's daughter was a beautiful, pious girl, and lived through the three years in the fear of God and without sin.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When therefore the time was over, and the day came when the evil one was to fetch her, she washed herself clean, and made a circle round herself with chalk.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The devil appeared quite early, but he could not come near to her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Angrily, he said to the miller, take all water away from her, that she may no longer be able to wash herself, for otherwise I have no power over her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The miller was afraid, and did so.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The next morning the devil came again, but she had wept on her hands, and they were quite clean.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Again he could not get near her, and furiously said to the miller, cut her hands off, or else I have no power over her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The miller was shocked and answered, how could I cut off my own child's hands.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the evil one threatened him and said, if you do not do it you are mine, and I will take you yourself.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The father became alarmed, and promised to obey him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So he went to the girl and said, my child, if I do not cut off both your hands, the devil will carry me away, and in my terror I have promised to do it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Help me in my need, and forgive me the harm I do you.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She replied, dear father, do with me what you will, I am your child.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Thereupon she laid down both her hands, and let them be cut off.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The devil came for the third time, but she had wept so long and so much on the stumps, that after all they were quite clean.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he had to give in, and had lost all right over her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The miller said to her, I have by means of you received such great wealth that I will keep you most handsomely as long as you live.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But she replied, here I cannot stay, I will go forth, compassionate people will give me as much as I require.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Thereupon she caused her maimed arms to be bound to her back, and by sunrise she set out on her way, and walked the whole day until night fell.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she came to a royal garden, and by the shimmering of the moon she saw that trees covered with beautiful fruits grew in it, but she could not enter, for it was surrounded by water.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And as she had walked the whole day and not eaten one mouthful, and hunger tormented her, she thought, ah, if I were but inside, that I might eat of the fruit, else must I die of hunger.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she knelt down, called on God the Lord, and prayed.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And suddenly an angel came towards her, who made a dam in the water, so that the moat became dry and she could walk through it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And now she went into the garden and the angel went with her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She saw a tree covered with beautiful pears, but they were all counted.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she went to them, and to still her hunger, ate one with her mouth from the tree, but no more.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The gardener was watching, but as the angel was standing by, he was afraid and thought the maiden was a spirit, and was silent, neither did he dare to cry out, or to speak to the spirit.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When she had eaten the pear, she was satisfied, and went and concealed herself among the bushes.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king to whom the garden belonged, came down to it next morning, and counted, and saw that one of the pears was missing, and asked the gardener what had become of it, as it was not lying beneath the tree, but was gone.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then answered the gardener, last night, a spirit came in, who had no hands, and ate off one of the pears with its mouth.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king said, how did the spirit get over the water, and where did it go after it had eaten the pear.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The gardener answered, someone came in a snow-white garment from heaven who made a dam, and kept back the water, that the spirit might walk through the moat.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And as it must have been an angel, I was afraid, and asked no questions, and did not cry out.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the spirit had eaten the pear, it went back again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king said, if it be as you say, I will watch with you to-night.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When it grew dark the king came into the garden and brought a priest with him, who was to speak to the spirit.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> All three seated themselves beneath the tree and watched.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At midnight the maiden came creeping out of the thicket, went to the tree, and again ate one pear off it with her mouth, and beside her stood the angel in white garments.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the priest went out to them and said, 'Do you come from heaven or from earth?</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Are you a spirit, or a human being'?</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She replied, 'I am no spirit, but an unhappy mortal deserted by all but God'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king said, 'If you are forsaken by all the world, yet will I not forsake you'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He took her with him into his royal palace, and as she was so beautiful and good, he loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her, and took her to wife.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> After a year the king had to go on a journey, so he commended his young queen to the care of his mother and said, if she is brought to child-bed take care of her, nurse her well, and tell me of it at once in a letter.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she gave birth to a fine boy.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So the old mother made haste to write and announce the joyful news to him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the messenger rested by a brook on the way, and as he was fatigued by the great distance, he fell asleep.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then came the devil, who was always seeking to injure the good queen, and exchanged the letter for another, in which was written that the queen had brought a monster into the world.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the king read the letter he was shocked and much troubled, but he wrote in answer that they were to take great care of the queen and nurse her well until his arrival.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The messenger went back with the letter, but rested at the same place and again fell asleep.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then came the devil once more, and put a different letter in his pocket, in which it was written that they were to put the queen and her child to death.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The old mother was terribly shocked when she received the letter, and could not believe it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She wrote back again to the king, but received no other answer, because each time the devil substituted a false letter, and in the last letter it was also written that she was to preserve the queen's tongue and eyes as a token that she had obeyed.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the old mother wept to think such innocent blood was to be shed, and had a hind brought by night and cut out her tongue and eyes, and kept them.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then said she to the queen, 'I cannot have you killed as the king commands, but here you may stay no longer.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Go forth into the wide world with your child, and never come here again'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The poor woman tied her child on her back, and went away with eyes full of tears.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She came into a great wild forest, and then she fell on her knees and prayed to God, and the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a little house on which was a sign with the words, here all dwell free.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> A snow-white maiden came out of the little house and said, welcome, lady queen, and conducted her inside.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she unbound the little boy from her back, and held him to her breast that he might feed, and laid him in a beautifully-made little bed.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then said the poor woman, 'From whence do you know that I was a queen'?</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The white maiden answered, 'I am an angel sent by God, to watch over you and your child'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The queen stayed seven years in the little house, and was well cared for, and by God's grace, because of her piety, her hands which had been cut off, grew once more.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At last the king came home again from his journey, and his first wish was to see his wife and the child.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then his aged mother began to weep and said, 'You wicked man, why did you write to me that I was to take those two innocent lives,' and she showed him the two letters which the evil one had forged, and then continued, 'I did as you bade me, and she showed the tokens, the tongue and eyes'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the king began to weep for his poor wife and his little son so much more bitterly than she was doing, that the aged mother had compassion on him and said, 'be at peace, she still lives, I secretly caused a hind to be killed, and took these tokens from it, but I bound the child to your wife's back and bade her go forth into the wide world, and made her promise never to come back here again, because you were so angry with her'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then spoke the king, 'I will go as far as the sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have found again my dear wife and my child, if in the meantime they have not been killed, or died of hunger'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Thereupon the king traveled about for seven long years, and sought her in every cleft of the rocks and in every cave, but he found her not, and thought she had died of want.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> During the whole time he neither ate nor drank, but God supported him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At length he came into a great forest, and found therein the little house whose sign was, here all dwell free.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then forth came the white maiden, took him by the hand, led him in, and said, 'Welcome, lord king,' and asked him from whence he came.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He answered, 'Soon shall I have traveled about for the space of seven years, and I seek my wife and her child, but cannot find them'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The angel offered him meat and drink, but he did not take anything, and only wished to rest a little.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he lay down to sleep, and laid a handkerchief over his face.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Thereupon the angel went into the chamber where the queen sat with her son, whom she usually called Sorrowful, and said to her, go out with your child, your husband has come.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So she went to the place where he lay, and the handkerchief fell from his face.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then said she, 'Sorrowful, pick up your father's handkerchief, and cover his face again'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The child picked it up, and put it over his face again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king in his sleep heard what passed, and had pleasure in letting the handkerchief fall once more.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the child grew impatient, and said, 'Dear mother, how can I cover my father's face when I have no father in this world.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I have learnt to say the prayer - Our Father, which art in heaven - you have told me that my father was in heaven, and was the good God, and how can I know a wild man like this.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He is not my father'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the king heard that, he got up, and asked who they were.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then said she, 'I am your wife, and that is your son, Sorrowful'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And he saw her living hands, and said, 'My wife had silver hands'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She answered, 'The good God has caused my natural hands to grow again,' and the angel went into the inner room, and brought the silver hands, and showed them to him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Hereupon he knew for a certainty that it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed them, and was glad, and said, 'A heavy stone has fallen from off my heart'.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the angel of God ate with them once again, and after that they went home to the king's aged mother.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> There were great rejoicings everywhere, and the king and queen were married again, and lived contentedly to their happy end.</div></div>
