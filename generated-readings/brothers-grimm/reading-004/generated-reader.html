    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence">There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So she called all seven to her and said, dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf, if he comes in, he will devour you all - skin, hair, and everything.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The kids said, dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves, you may go away without any anxiety.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door and called, open the door, dear children, your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> We will not open the door, cried they, you are not our mother.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough, you are the wolf.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called, open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried, we will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you, you are the wolf.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the wolf ran to a baker and said, I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said, strew some white meal over my feet for me.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The miller thought to himself, the wolf wants to deceive someone, and refused, but the wolf said, if you will not do it, I will devour you.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Truly, this the way of mankind.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said, open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The little kids cried, first show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he put his paws in through the window, and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But who should come in but the wolf they were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony, one after the other he swallowed them down his throat.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ah.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What a sight she saw there.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The house-door stood wide open.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She called them one after another by name, but no one answered.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At last, when she caame to the youngest, a soft voice cried, dear mother, I am in the clock-case.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ah, heavens, she said, is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread and the goat cut open the monster's stomach, and hardly had she make one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What rejoicing there was.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a sailor at his wedding.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The mother, however, said, now go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast's stomach with them while he is still asleep.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the seven kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into his stomach as they could get in, and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But when he began to walk and move about, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then cried he, what rumbles and tumbles against my poor bones.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I thought 'twas six kids, but it feels like big stones.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the heavy stones made him fall in, and he had to drown miserably.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud, the wolf is dead.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The wolf is dead, and danced for joy round about the well with their mother.</div></div>
