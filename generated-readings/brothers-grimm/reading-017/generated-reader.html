  <div>Source: The Riddle</div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence">There was once a king's son who was seized with a desire to travel about the world, and took no one with him but a faithful servant.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> One day he came to a great forest, and when darkness overtook him he could find no shelter, and knew not where to pass the night.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he saw a girl who was going towards a small house, and when he came nearer, he saw that the maiden was young and beautiful.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He spoke to her, and said, dear child, can I and my servant find shelter for the night in the little house.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Oh, yes, said the girl in a sad voice, that you certainly can, but I do not advise you to venture it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Do not go in.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Why not, asked the king's son.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The maiden sighed and said, my step-mother practises wicked arts.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She is ill-disposed toward strangers.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he saw very well that he had come to the house of a witch, but as it was dark, and he could not go farther, and also was not afraid, he entered.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The old woman was sitting in an armchair by the fire, and looked at the stranger with her red eyes.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Good evening, growled she, and pretended to be quite friendly.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Take a seat and rest yourselves.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She fanned the fire on which she was cooking something in a small pot.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The daughter warned the two to be prudent, to eat nothing, and drink nothing, for the old woman brewed evil drinks.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> They slept quietly until early morning.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When they were making ready for their departure, and the king's son was already seated on his horse, the old woman said, stop a moment, I will first hand you a parting draught.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Whilst she fetched it, the king's son rode away, and the servant who had to buckle his saddle tight, was the only one present when the wicked witch came with the drink.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Take that to your master, said she.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But at that instant the glass broke and the poison spirted on the horse, and it was so strong that the animal immediately fell down dead.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The servant ran after his master and told him what had happened, but as he did not want to leave his saddle behind, he ran back to fetch it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When he came to the dead horse, however, a raven was already sitting on it devouring it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Who knows whether we shall find anything better to-day, said the servant.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So he killed the raven, and took it with him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And now they journeyed onwards into the forest the whole day, but could not get out of it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> By nightfall they found an inn and entered it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The servant gave the raven to the innkeeper to prepare for supper.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> They had stumbled, however, on a den of murderers, and during the darkness twelve of these came, intending to kill the strangers and rob them.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But before they set about this work, they sat down to supper, and the innkeeper and the witch sat down with them, and together they ate a dish of soup in which was cut up the flesh of the raven.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Hardly had they swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, before they all fell down dead, for the raven had communicated to them the poison from the horse-flesh.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> There was no no one else left in the house but the innkeeper's daughter, who was honest, and had taken no part in their godless deeds.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She opened all doors to the stranger and showed him the store of treasures.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the king's son said she might keep everything, he would have none of it, and rode onwards with his servant.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> After they had traveled about for a long time, they came to a town in which was a beautiful but proud princess, who had made it known that whosoever should set her a riddle which she could not guess, that man should be her husband.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But if she guessed it, his head must be cut off.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She had three days to guess it in, but was so clever that she always found the answer to the riddle given her before the appointed time.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Nine suitors had already perished in this manner, when the king's son arrived, and blinded by her great beauty, was willing to stake his life for it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he went to her and laid his riddle before her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What is this, said he.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> One slew none, and yet slew twelve.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She did not know what that was.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She thought and thought, but she could not solve it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She opened her riddle-books, but it was not in them - in short, her wisdom was at an end.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As she did not know how to help herself, she ordered her maid to creep into the lord's sleeping-chamber, and listen to his dreams, and thought that he would perhaps speak in his sleep and reveal the riddle.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the clever servant had placed himself in the bed instead of his master, and when the maid came there, he tore off from her the mantle in which she had wrapped herself, and chased her out with rods.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The second night the king's daughter sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to see if she could succeed better in listening, but the servant took her mantle also away from her, and hunted her out with rods.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Now the master believed himself safe for the third night, and lay down in his own bed.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then came the princess herself, and she had put on a misty-grey mantle, and she seated herself near him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And when she thought that he was asleep and dreaming, she spoke to him, and hoped that he would answer in his sleep, as many do, but he was awake, and understood and heard everything quite well.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she asked, one slew none, what is that.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He replied, a raven, which ate of a dead and poisoned horse, and died of it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She inquired further, and yet slew twelve, what is that.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He answered, that means twelve murderers, who ate the raven and died of it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When she knew the answer to the riddle she wanted to steal away, but he held her mantle so fast that she was forced to leave it behind her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Next morning, the king's daughter announced that she had guessed the riddle, and sent for the twelve judges and expounded it before them.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the youth begged for a hearing, and said, she stole into my room in the night and questioned me, otherwise she could not have discovered it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The judges said, bring us a proof of this.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then were the three mantles brought thither by the servant, and when the judges saw the misty-grey one which the king's daughter usually wore, they said, let the mantle be embroidered with gold and silver, and then it will be your wedding-mantle.</div></div>
