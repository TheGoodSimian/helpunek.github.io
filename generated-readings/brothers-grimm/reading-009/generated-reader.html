    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence">There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion - rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, what ails you, dear wife.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ah, she replied, if I can't eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The man, who loved her, thought, sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It tasted so good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> How can you dare, said she with angry look, descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> You shall suffer for it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ah, answered he, let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, if the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of rapunzel, and took it away with her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried, rapunzel, rapunzel, let down your hair to me.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> After a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode through the forest and passed by the tower.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> This was rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried, rapunzel, rapunzel, let down your hair.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune, said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried, rapunzel, rapunzel, let down your hair.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Immediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> At first rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the king's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought, he will love me more than old dame gothel does.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And she said yes, and laid her hand in his.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She said, I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once rapunzel said to her, tell me, dame gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king's son - he is with me in a moment.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ah.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> You wicked child, cried the enchantress.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What do I hear you say.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In her anger she clutched rapunzel's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And she was so pitiless that she took poor rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> On the same day that she cast out rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king's son came and cried, rapunzel, rapunzel, let down your hair, she let the hair down.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king's son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Aha, she cried mockingly, you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Rapunzel is lost to you.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> You will never see her again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king's son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.</div></div>
