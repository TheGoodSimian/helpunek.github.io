    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence">Little brother took his little sister by the hand and said, since our mother died we have had no happiness.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Our step-mother beats us every day, and if we come near her she kicks us away with her foot.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Our meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left over.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And the little dog under the table is better off, for she often throws it a choice morsel.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> God pity us, if our mother only knew.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Come, we will go forth together into the wide world.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> They walked the whole day over meadows, fields, and stony places.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And when it rained the little sister said, heaven and our hearts are weeping together.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In the evening they came to a large forest, and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the long walk, that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The next day when they awoke, the sun was already high in the sky, and shone down hot into the tree.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the brother said, sister, I am thirsty.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> If I knew of a little brook I would go and just take a drink.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I think I hear one running.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The brother got up and took the little sister by the hand, and they set off to find the brook.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the wicked step-mother was a witch, and had seen how the two children had gone away, and had crept after them secretly, as witches creep, and had bewitched all the brooks in the forest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Now when they found a little brook leaping brightly over the stones, the brother was going to drink out of it, but the sister heard how it said as it ran, who drinks of me will be a tiger.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Who drinks of me will be a tiger.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the sister cried, pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and tear me to pieces.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The brother did not drink, although he was so thirsty, but said, I will wait for the next spring.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When they came to the next brook the sister heard this also say, who drinks of me will be a wolf.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Who drinks of me will be a wolf.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the sister cried out, pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wolf, and devour me.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The brother did not drink, and said, I will wait until we come to the next spring, but then I must drink, say what you like.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> For my thirst is too great.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And when they came to the third brook the sister heard how it said as it ran, who drinks of me will be a roebuck.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Who drinks of me will be a roebuck.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The sister said, oh, I pray you, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a roebuck, and run away from me.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the brother had knelt down at once by the brook, and had bent down and drunk some of the water, and as soon as the first drops touched his lips he lay there in the form of a young roebuck.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And now the sister wept over her poor bewitched brother, and the little roe wept also, and sat sorrowfully near to her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But at last the girl said, be quiet, dear little roe, I will never, never leave you.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she untied her golden garter and put it round the roebuck's neck, and she plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> This she tied to the little animal and led it on, and she walked deeper and deeper into the forest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And when they had gone a very long way they came at last to a little house, and the girl looked in.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And as it was empty, she thought, we can stay here and live.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she sought for leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the roe.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself, and brought tender grass for the roe, who ate out of her hand, and was content and played round about her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In the evening, when the sister was tired, and had said her prayer, she laid her head upon the roebuck's back - that was her pillow, and she slept softly on it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And if only the brother had had his human form it would have been a delightful life.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> For some time they were alone like this in the wilderness.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But it happened that the king of the country held a great hunt in the forest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the blasts of the horns, the barking of dogs and the merry shouts of the huntsmen rang through the trees, and the roebuck heard all, and was only too anxious to be there.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Oh, said he, to his sister, let me be off to the hunt, I cannot bear it any longer, and he begged so much that at last she agreed.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But, said she to him, come back to me in the evening.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I must shut my door for fear of the rough huntsmen, so knock and say, my little sister, let me in, that I may know you.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And if you do not say that, I shall not open the door.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the young roebuck sprang away.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So happy was he and so merry in the open air.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king and the huntsmen saw the lovely animal, and started after him, but they could not catch him, and when they thought that they surely had him, away he sprang through the bushes and vanished.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When it was dark he ran to the cottage, knocked, and said, my little sister, let me in.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the door was opened for him, and he jumped in, and rested himself the whole night through upon his soft bed.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The next day the hunt began again, and when the roebuck once more heard the bugle-horn, and the ho.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Ho.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Of the huntsmen, he had no peace, but said, sister, let me out, I must be off.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> His sister opened the door for him, and said, but you must be here again in the evening and say your pass-word.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the king and his huntsmen again saw the young roebuck with the golden collar, they all chased him, but he was too quick and nimble for them.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> This lasted the whole day, but by the evening the huntsmen had surrounded him, and one of them wounded him a little in the foot, so that he limped and ran slowly.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then a hunter crept after him to the cottage and heard how he said, my little sister, let me in, and saw that the door was opened for him, and was shut again at once.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The huntsman took notice of it all, and went to the king and told him what he had seen and heard.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the king said, to-morrow we will hunt once more.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She washed the blood off him, laid herbs on the wound, and said, go to your bed, dear roe, that you may get well again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the wound was so slight that the roebuck, next morning, did not feel it any more.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And when he again heard the sport outside, he said, I cannot bear it, I must be there.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> They shall not find it so easy to catch me.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The sister cried, and said, this time they will kill you, and here am I alone in the forest and forsaken by all the world.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> I will not let you out.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then you will have me die of grief, answered the roe.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When I hear the bugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the sister could not do otherwise, but opened the door for him with a heavy heart, and the roebuck, full of health and joy, bounded into the forest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When the king saw him, he said to his huntsmen, now chase him all day long till night-fall, but take care that no one does him any harm.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As soon as the sun had set, the king said to the huntsman, now come and show me the cottage in the wood.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And when he was at the door, he knocked and called out, dear little sister, let me in.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the door opened, and the king walked in, and there stood a maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The maiden was frightened when she saw, not her little roe, but a man come in who wore a golden crown upon his head.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the king looked kindly at her, stretched out his hand, and said, will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Yes, indeed, answered the maiden, but the little roe must go with me, I cannot leave him.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king said, it shall stay with you as long as you live, and shall want nothing.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Just then he came running in, and the sister again tied him with the cord of rushes, took it in her own hand, and went away with the king from the cottage.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried her to his palace, where the wedding was held with great pomp.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She was now the queen, and they lived for a long time happily together.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The roebuck was tended and cherished, and ran about in the palace-garden.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the wicked step-mother, because of whom the children had gone out into the world, had never thought but that the sister had been torn to pieces by the wild beasts in the wood, and that the brother had been shot for a roebuck by the huntsmen.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Now when she heard that they were so happy, and so well off, envy and jealousy rose in her heart and left her no peace, and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Her own daughter, who was ugly as night, and had only one eye, reproached her and said, a queen.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> That ought to have been my luck.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Just be quiet, answered the old woman, and comforted her by saying, when the time comes I shall be ready.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> As time went on the queen had a pretty little boy, and it happened that the king was out hunting.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So the old witch took the form of the chamber maid, went into the room where the queen lay, and said to her, come the bath is ready.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> It will do you good, and give you fresh strength.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Make haste before it gets cold.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Her daughter also was close by.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> So they carried the weakly queen into the bath-room, and put her into the bath.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then they shut the door and ran away.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But in the bath-room they had made a fire of such hellish heat that the beautiful young queen was soon suffocated.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When this was done the old woman took her daughter, put a nightcap on her head, and laid her in bed in place of the queen.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She gave her too the shape and look of the queen, only she could not make good the lost eye.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But in order that the king might not see it, she was to lie on the side on which she had no eye.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In the evening when he came home and heard that he had a son he was heartily glad, and was going to the bed of his dear wife to see how she was.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But the old woman quickly called out, for your life leave the curtains closed.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The queen ought not to see the light yet, and must have rest.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king went away, and did not find out that a false queen was lying in the bed.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> But at midnight, when all slept, the nurse, who was sitting in the nursery by the cradle, and who was the only person awake, saw the door open and the true queen walk in.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She took the child out of the cradle, laid it on her arm, and suckled it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she shook up its pillow, laid the child down again, and covered it with the little quilt.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And she did not forget the roebuck, but went into the corner where it lay, and stroked its back.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she went quite silently out of the door again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The next morning the nurse asked the guards whether anyone had come into the palace during the night, but they answered, no, we have seen no one.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She came thus many nights and never spoke a word.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The nurse always saw her, but she did not dare to tell anyone about it.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> When some time had passed in this manner, the queen began to speak in the night, and said, how fares my child, how fares my roe.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Twice shall I come, then never more.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The nurse did not answer, but when the queen had gone again, went to the king and told him all.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king said, ah, God.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> What is this.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> To-morrow night I will watch by the child.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> In the evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the queen again appeared and said, how fares my child, how fares my roe.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Once will I come, then never more.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she disappeared.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king dared not speak to her, but on the next night he watched again.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she said, how fares my child, how fares my roe.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> This time I come, then never more.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then the king could not restrain himself.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> He sprang towards her, and said, you can be none other than my dear wife.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> She answered, yes, I am your dear wife, and at the same moment she received life again, and by God's grace became fresh, rosy and full of health.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> Then she told the king the evil deed which the wicked witch and her daughter had been guilty of towards her.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The king ordered both to be led before the judge, and the judgment was delivered against them.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> The daughter was taken into the forest where she was torn to pieces by wild beasts, but the witch was cast into the fire and miserably burnt.</div></div>
    <div class="sentenceContainer"><div class="sentence"> And as soon as she was burnt to ashes, the roebuck changed his shape, and received his human form again, so the sister and brother lived happily together all their lives.</div></div>
